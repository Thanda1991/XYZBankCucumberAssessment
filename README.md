# Automation Test Framework

## Overview

This repository contains an object-oriented automation test framework designed to automate test cases for the banking application available at [Way2Automation](http://www.way2automation.com/angularjs-protractor/banking/#/login). The framework is built using an open-source automation framework, emphasizing best practices in object-oriented programming, reporting, and maintainability.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements OOP principles for better structure and reusability.
- **Rich Reporting**: Generates detailed reports with outputs and screenshots of the test execution.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands to execute tests and generate reports.

## Tools Used
- **Intellij**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Java with Maven**: For enhanced code quality and readability.
### Reporting Tools
- **Allure Report**
- **Extents Report**


## Prerequisites
